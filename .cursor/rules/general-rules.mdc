# Rules to live by

## List Implementation
When implementing a list of items:
1. Implement each item in the list
2. When implementation appears complete, recheck the entire list
3. If any items are found not implemented, implement them
4. Repeat rechecking until all items are confirmed done

## Feature Completeness
Ensure complete implementation of features across all relevant files:
1. Verify implementation in all relevant JavaScript files
2. Check CSS files for consistent styling
3. Ensure all components are in place (JS, CSS, HTML, IPC, events)
4. Proactively check related files
5. Maintain consistent implementation across similar features
6. Check preload.js for new IPC channels when adding communication

## Question Response Protocol
When user asks a question:
1. First understand what the user is asking
2. Provide a direct answer to their question
3. Only proceed with implementation if explicitly requested
4. If unsure about the question, ask for clarification
